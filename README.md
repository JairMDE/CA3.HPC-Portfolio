# High-Performance Python Project

This repository contains a collection of exercises and optimizations focused on high-performance computing in Python. The project explores various techniques to enhance Python code execution speed and efficiency, ranging from profiling and benchmarking to using Cython for compiling Python code to C. The main results and visualizations of these optimizations are detailed in the `Cython_vis.ipynb` and `Portfolio.ipynb` notebooks.

## Overview

The project is structured into five main parts, each targeting different aspects of high-performance computing in Python:

1. **Benchmarking and Profiling**: Introduction to performance measurement tools and techniques.
2. **Lists and Tuples**: Optimizing operations on Python lists and exploring the advantages of `collections.deque`.
3. **Dictionaries and Sets**: Utilizing Python's built-in data structures for efficient data manipulation.
4. **Matrix and Vector Computations**: Leveraging NumPy and NumExpr for fast array operations.
5. **Compiling to C with Cython**: Enhancing Python code performance by compiling to C using Cython.

Each part is accompanied by exercises that demonstrate practical applications of the concepts discussed, with a focus on the Conway's Game of Life simulation as a case study for Cython optimizations and the Julia set for the Profilers.
